Hey, what's up everybody? This is Tammy. Welcome back to our course on, How To Make A Game Like Flappy Bird In Swift.

In this video, you'll finally get to add the star of the show... Felipe! 

Take a look.

Pretty cool, huh? Want to know what's even cooler? GameplayKit, which happens to be one of my favorite frameworks.

GameplayKit is a collection of tools, created by Apple, that help us developer build games in iOS, macOS, tvOS and even watchOS. 

While this course doesn't focus on GameplayKit, it does, use a few of these technologies. The first being Entities and components, which helps keep code more organized. 


**SLIDE 22**

There are two parts to the entity-component system. They are:

Entities, which essentially represents the objects within your game. And components, which represent some aspect of an entity - like its appearance or behavior.

In Flappy Felipe, we’ll use a entity named PlayerEntity to represent the bird, which is a custom subclass of GKEntity.

We’ll also create two components.

The first is a visual component, which handles the onscreen visual representation of the player. The classname for this component is SpriteComponent.

The second component is one responsible for handling the player's movement. The classname for this one is MovementComponent.

Both of these components are subclasses of the GKComponent class, and because they are components can be reused later, with other entities.

OK! It's time to jump into Xcode and get Felipe onto the stage, or more accurately - the scene!

That’s it for this video, where you were learned about GameplayKit and entities and components. In the next video, you'll continue to use GameplayKit, and you'll also discover how to add obstacles to the scene.

Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time!

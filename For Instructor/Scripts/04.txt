Pretty cool, huh? Want to know what's even cooler? GameplayKit, which happens to be one of my favorite frameworks.

GameplayKit is a collection of tools, created by Apple, that exist to assist us with building games in iOS, macOS, tvOS and even watchOS. 

While this series doesn't focus on GameplayKit, it does, however, use a few of these technologies.


**SLIDE 23**

[TODO Tammy - please majorly expand this section. The goal is for students to understand what is going on here without having to refer to other tutorials.]

The first being Entities and components.

Using the Entity-Component design pattern helps to keep code more organized. 

In Flappy Felipe, we’ll use a entity named PlayerEntity to represent the bird. This entity is a custom subclass of GKEntity.

We’ll also create two components. 

The first is a visual component which handles the onscreen visual representation of the player. In this case, the bird. 

The classname for this component is SpriteComponent.

The second component is the one responsible for handling the player's movement. The classname for this one is MovementComponent.

Both of these components are subclasses of the GKComponent class.

OK! It's time to jump into Xcode and get Felipe onto the stage, or more accurately - the scene!

That’s it for this video, hope you enjoyed it. In the next video, you'll continue to use GameplayKit, and you'll also discover how to add obstacles to the scene.

Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time!

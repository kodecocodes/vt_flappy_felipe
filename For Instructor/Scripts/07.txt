Hey, what's up everybody? This is Tammy. Welcome back to our video tutorial series, How To Make A Game Like Flappy Bird In Swift.

In this video, you'll learn about game states and how to use GameplayKit to help manage them.

With GameplayKit, you're able to create and manage the different game states within your game.

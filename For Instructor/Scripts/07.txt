A lot of games have a paused state, a game over state and a playing state. And each of these states usually require different things to happen or independent game logic to run; whether it be different animations, different music, or different player interactions.

With GameplayKit, you're able to easily create and manage the different game states within your game. 

The best part? You can do this without having to nest endless if statements, which is what you had to do in the past.

It works by creating a state machine, which manages and handles the different game states. The class responsible for this is GKStateMachine. 

And the way that you create the different game states is by using the GKState class. Then, when you need to change states, you simply ask the state machine to switch.


Let’s take a closer look at this in code.

In games, you might have a paused-state, a game-over state and a playing state. Each of these states may require different things to happen; different animation, different music, different interactions, etc. 

With GameplayKit, you're able to create and manage the different game states within your game. 

The best part? You can do this without having to nest endless if statements, which is what you had to do in the past.

**SLIDE 64**
The Apple TV was released in late October 2015; and with it, tvOS. 


**SLIDE 65**
tvOS is to Apple TV what iOS is to the iPhone and iPad. With a few differences.

Firstly, let's talk about the elephant in the room... that beautiful 1080p display. Who hasn't dreamed about playing Flappy Felipe on the big screen, right?

Secondly, the Apple TV Remote is more than just a device to change the channel or turn up the volume.

The Apple TV remote has Siri, a touch surface and even an accelerometer and gyroscope. While it's true you'll need to think differently in terms of controls — for example, the Apple TV is not a touchscreen device — don't think of this as a limitation; there's a lot that can be done with this remote.


**SLIDE 66**
Another huge benefit for developers is that tvOS leverages existing frameworks like SpriteKit, UIKit, Metal and so forth.

And finally, with Apple TV not only can you create Traditional Apps, but you can also create Client-Server apps using JavaScript and TVML, Apple's Television Markup Language.


**SLIDE 67**
Apple TV and tvOS are big topics to tackle. 

This video tutorial will only cover a small portion of what's possible in tvOS, and more specifically, how to get Flappy Felipe ported.

One of the two things this video will cover is dealing with the Apple TV and capturing user input, specifically the tap event, which we'll handle by extending the GameScene to handle taps specifically form the Siri Remote.


**SLIDE 69**
For an in-depth look at programming for the Apple TV, be sure to watch our course on Beginning Native tvOS Apps.


**SLIDE 70**
The second thing we'll be covering in this part of the course is adding the App Icon and the Top Shelf image.

In Apple TV, the App Icon has a layered effect and when the user puts your app in the top row, the top shelf content within your app appears. This content may be static or dynamic. This video will only cover static content.

OK! Let's begin.

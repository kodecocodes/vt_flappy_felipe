**SLIDE 3**
Before we get started, I want to share with you how Flappy Felipe came to be.

You see, Felipe Laso Marsetti, a Ray Wenderlich Founding Tutorial Team Member, had this dream about becoming a cartoon bird. 


**SLIDE 4**
One day, he mentioned this dream to Ray; which of course, gave Ray an idea! Why not create a game like Flappy Bird, and make Felipe that star of the show?


**SLIDE 5**
So Ray contacted Mike Berg at weheartgames.com and asked him to create the artwork. Not too long after that, Flappy Felipe was available on the App Store!

And now you can learn how to make this game in this course.


**SLIDE 6**
But first, it's time to go over some of the things you need to know before you begin.

For starters, you should know how to program in Swift.

If you need a little help with that, you can watch our Swift courses; or you can grab a copy of our book, the Swift Apprentice. Better yet, do both!

You should also understand the basics of SpriteKit, Apple's 2D Game Engine framework. 

If you're new to SpriteKit, we have a Beginning SpriteKit course to help you get up to speed. We also have our book, 2D Apple Games by Tutorials, as well as our free tutorials on the site.


**SLIDE 7**
With that out of the way, it's time to review the specifics of what this course will cover.

We’ll start by creating the project and adding the background. 

Then, we’ll move on to learning some of the features of GameplayKit. Specifically, Entities and Components, Randomization, and State Machines.

Finally, you'll discover how to add "juice" to your game, which is a fancy way of saying “adding polish and pizazz”. And we'll conclude the course by learning how to get Flappy Felipe working on the Apple TV.

As you can see, we cover a lot of things in this course.


**SLIDE 8**
Well that’s it for this video, where you learned about this course and what you'll be making. In the next video, you’ll learn how to set up the project and add the background.

I hope you enjoyed this video. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time!

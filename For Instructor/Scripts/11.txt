Hey, what's up everybody? This is Tammy. Welcome back to our course on, How To Make A Game Like Flappy Bird In Swift.

In this video, you'll help Felipe bird get his groove on.  


**SLIDE 49**
Animating your sprites may seem complicated, but it's not too bad once you understand the process.

In order to get Felipe's wings to flap, you'll be using a series of four images. These four images are identical, expect for the position of his wings. As you cycle through each image, it beings to look like he's flapping his wings.

Luckily, for us developers, SpriteKit includes an easy way to animate these images using SKTextures.  [TODO Tammy: Describe how this works.]

In addition to animating the Felipe Wing Flap, as its known throughout the land, you'll also be adding a little rotation to make his flight pattern a bit more realistic.

When the player taps to make the wings flap, you'll rotate the bird so he's pointing upward. When the player stops tapping, Felipe stops flapping, and he rotates down.

But first, you'll need to figure out how much to rotate Felipe, per second. You can do this using angular velocity and the the modifier — the plus or minus 1000.

In physics, angular velocity applies to objects that move along a circular path. [DO HAND GESTURE]. 

Once you have these things, you can set the zPosition on the sprite and get him pointing in the right direction. 

Let's see this in action.

That’s it for this video, where you were learned how to animate sprites. In the next video, you'll add some finishing touches, including the app icon, launch screen and even a secret item made especially for Felipe. Uh, the bird, not the person. Hmm… then again, maybe both!

Well, anyway… Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time!

Hey, what's up everybody? This is Tammy. Welcome back to our course on, How To Make A Game Like Flappy Bird In Swift.

In this part of the course, you'll help Felipe get his groove on.  


**SLIDE 54**
By the end of this video, your game will look like this.

Animating your sprites may seem complicated, but it's not too bad once you understand the process.

In order to get Felipe's wings to flap, you'll be using a series of four images. These four images are identical, expect for the position of his wings. As you cycle through each image, it looks like he's flapping his wings.

It does this using SKTextures and the animate(with:timePerFrame:) action.

You create an array of images and then pass that array into the function. The function then takes those images and swaps them out using the time per frame you passed into the function.

Whaa-lah - instant animation!

**SLIDE 56**
In addition to animating Felipe's Wing Flap, you'll also add a little rotation to make his flight pattern a bit more realistic.

When the player taps to make the wings flap, you'll rotate the bird so he's pointing upward. When the player stops tapping, Felipe stops flapping, and he rotates down.

But first, you'll need to figure out how much to rotate Felipe, per second. You can do this using angular velocity and the the modifier: the plus or minus 1000.

In physics, angular velocity applies to objects that move along a circular path. [DO HAND GESTURE]. 

Once you have these things worked out, you can set the zPosition on the sprite and get him pointing in the right direction. 

Let's see how to work this out in Xcode.

**SLIDE 57**
Well, that’s it for this video, where you were learned how to animate sprites. In the next video, you'll add some finishing touches, including the app icon, launch screen and even a secret item made especially for Felipe. Uh, the bird, not the person. Hmm… then again, maybe both!

Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time!

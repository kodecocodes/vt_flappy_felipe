Hey, what's up everybody? This is Tammy. I hope you enjoyed our course on, How To Make A Game Like Flappy Bird In Swift.

In this course, we started by creating the project and adding the background. 

Then, we talked about GameplayKit. Specifically, Entities and Components, Randomization, and State Machines.

Finally, we added juice to the game — and more importantly — saw how to get it working on the Apple TV.

Yeah, we covered a lot.

But if you’re still looking for more SpriteKit-based learning, be sure to check out the Apple SpriteKit docs, our tutorials on the site, and of course, our book: 2D Apple Games by Tutorials.

Well, folks... although this course has come to an end, don't let that stop you. Take the skills you picked up here and make your own version of Flappy Felipe. Get it on the App store and let us know about it. We’d love to see what you’re doing.

That’s it for this video and this course. Thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next time.

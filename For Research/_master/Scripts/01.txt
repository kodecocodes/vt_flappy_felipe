Hey, what's up everybody? This is Tammy. Welcome you to our video tutorial series, How To Make A Game Like Flappy Bird In Swift.


**SLIDE 2**
In this series, you’ll learn how to make a game named Flappy Felipe. If you don't know the folklore behind Flappy Felipe, I've been told that it goes something like this: 


**SLIDE 3**
Felipe Laso Marsetti, a Ray Wenderlich Founding Tutorial Team Member, had a dream about becoming a cartoon bird. 


**SLIDE 4**
One day, he mentioned his dream to Ray... and that gave Ray an idea! Why not make a game like Flappy Bird, starring Felipe.


**SLIDE 5**
So Ray contacted Mike Berg over at weheartgames.com and asked him to create some artwork. And not too long after that, Flappy Felipe was made available on the App Store! Huzzah!


**SLIDE 6**
So now that you know what you’re making, it's time to go over some of the things you need to know in order to work through this series. 

Firstly, you should know how to program in Swift. If you need a little help with the Swift language, check out some of our Swift Video Tutorials or take a look at our iOS Apprentice book.

You should also understand the basics of SpriteKit, Apple's 2D Game Engine framework. 

If you're new to SpriteKit, we have free tutorials available on our site to help get you started. After you look through those, come back here, and we can get started making Flappy Felipe.

Alternatively, you can grab a copy of our book, 2D Apple Games by Tutorials.

With that out of the way, it's time to review the specifics of what this series will cover.


**SLIDE 7**
We’ll start by creating the project and adding the background. 

Then, we’ll move on to learning about GameplayKit. Specifically, you'll see how to use Entities and Components, Randomization, and State Machines.

Finally, you'll discover how to add juice to your game — and more importantly — how to get it working on the Apple TV.

As you can see, a lot is covered in this series. And by the end, you'll have enough knowledge to build your own Flappy Felipe-type game.

**SLIDE 8**
Before we wrap-up, I'd like to give a special thanks to the two tech editors on this series, Richard Critz and James Taylor. Thanks, guys, for making this series epic.

**SLIDE 9**
That’s it for this video, hope you enjoyed it. In the next video, you’ll learn how to add the background.

Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time!
